# MinneMUDAC-Data-Science-Challenge-Fall-2018

This repository contains my worklog, data/wrangling, training and functions notebooks for the MinneMUDAC Data Science Challenge, Fall 2018. Follow the link https://minneanalytics.org/minnemudac/ for the project description.

The data/wrangling and training notebooks are just neater/more-organised versions of the code in the worklog.
